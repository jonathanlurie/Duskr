SettingFileReader needs tobe used with only two functions: constructor and getter.

Constructor: default is without any argument. In this case the "setting.ini" file
    will be used. You can specify another file using a relative address
    (from the launcher) or absolute.


getSetting : returns the parameter written in "setting.ini" (by default) after casting it
    to float if it's a float, to int if it's an integer or to string in other cases.

    Takes two arguments:
        group : the group of arguments, writen between square brackets
        name : name of the argument
